# I Am Alive

An exceedingly dumb service to see if your servers are still alive.

Please don't use this. Use [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/),
[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com), [New Relic](https://www.newrelic.com), or
any of the myriad better solutions. I don't even use this, it was just a quick
test.

Requires POSTing the value `computer_name` to `/checkin`.
